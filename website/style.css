/* CSS Notes
1. Body:
  max-width: 40em;
    This sets the maximum width of the body element to 40em.
    An em is a scalable unit that is used in web document media.
    An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt.
  margin: 0 auto;
    This rule centers the body element horizontally within its containing element.
    The '0' removes any top and bottom margins, while 'auto' evenly distributes the left and right margins.
  padding: 5px;
    This sets the padding space required between the content of the element and its border to 5 pixels on all four sides.
  font-family: sans-serif;
    This rule sets the font of the text within the body to be any 'sans-serif' font.
  font-weight: lighter;
    This sets the thickness of the font within the body to 'lighter'.
    This usually corresponds to a font weight of 300.
  font-size: 18px;
    This sets the size of the font within the body to be 18 pixels.
  line-height: 1.6em;
    This sets the distance between lines to be 1.6 times the size of the current font size.
  color: black;
    This sets the color of the text within the body to be black.
  background-color: white;
    This sets the background color of the body to be white.
2. h1, h2, h3, h4:
  font-family: sans-serif;
    This rule sets the font of the text within the h1, h2, h3, and h4 elements to be any 'sans-serif' font.
  font-weight: normal;
    This sets the thickness of the font within the h1, h2, h3, and h4 elements to 'normal'.
  background-color: white;
    This sets the background color of the h1, h2, h3, and h4 elements to be white.
  
  Note that the body's styles apply to all elements within the body, 
  but specific styles declared for h1, h2, h3, and h4 will override the corresponding styles in the body for these elements.
